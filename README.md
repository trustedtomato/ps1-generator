# PS1 generator
Create nice looking PS1 variables easily. 

## Live demo
You can check out the live demo here: [https://trustedtomato.github.io/ps1-generator/](https://trustedtomato.github.io/ps1-generator/)

## Motivation
There are existing PS1 generators, why create another one?
- The existing drag & drop interfaces are rather bad in my opinion
- For learning purposes - I could learn the special characters and
the syntax of text formatting in the terminal while developing the app
